I finally made my first website (with templates and guidelines). I hope to write about _algorithms_ I studied or am going to research on. My research focuses on image reconstruction for biomedical and astronomical imaging through **optimisation** algorithms and deep **learning**. I am interested in photography, gaming, music and travelling.  

Through this website, I want to research on algorithms that would help me improve image quality of the photos I take, such as denoising and deblurring. Although MATLAB would be the easiest way to code for this purpose, I would like to use **Python** as it is more widely used in the industry and it allows larger degree of freedom in software development.
