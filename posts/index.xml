I hope to write about algorithms I studied or am going to research on. My research focuses on image reconstruction for biomedical and astronomical imaging through optimisation algorithms and deep learning. I am interested in photography, gaming, music and travelling.
Through this website, I want to research on algorithms that would help me improve image quality of the photos I take, such as denoising and deblurring.</description></item></channel></rss>
